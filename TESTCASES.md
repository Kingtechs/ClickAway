## 2. Usability Tests

### 2.1 UI Feedback & Responsiveness

| ID | Test Case | Criteria |
|----|-----------|----------|
| U-UI01 | Click feedback appears on hit | A `+N` floating label appears at the click position within one frame |
| U-UI02 | Score display updates immediately | Score number changes without a visible delay after each hit |
| U-UI03 | Timer color changes when low | Timer text visually warns (e.g. turns red) when ≤5 s remain |
| U-UI04 | Screen shakes on streak milestone | At streak multiples of 10, a brief screen shake animation plays |
| U-UI05 | "End Practice Round" button does not shift layout | In Practice mode the button sits inline with the stats row — the arena does not move |
| U-UI06 | Powerup tray fills correctly | Segment bar for each powerup fills smoothly as streak builds; does not overfill |
| U-UI07 | Game Over overlay shows final stats | After a round, the overlay displays score, hits, misses, and streak |
| U-UI08 | Shop preview reflects equipped item | Equipping a skin in the shop updates the preview card without a page reload |
| U-UI09 | Navbar active link highlighted | The nav item for the current route is visually active |
| U-UI10 | Layout adapts below 700 px | At mobile widths the powerup tray, HUD, and arena stack without overflow |

---

### 2.2 Navigation & Routing

| ID | Test Case | Criteria |
|----|-----------|----------|
| U-NAV01 | Unauthenticated users are redirected | Visiting `/game`, `/shop`, etc. without a token redirects to `/login` |
| U-NAV02 | Authenticated users skip login | Visiting `/login` or `/signup` while logged in redirects to `/game` |
| U-NAV03 | Reload preserves session | Hard-refreshing any protected page does not log the user out (token re-verified via `/api/auth/me`) |
| U-NAV04 | 404 / unknown routes handled | Navigating to a non-existent path shows a graceful fallback, not a blank screen |

---

### 2.3 Accessibility

| ID | Test Case | Criteria |
|----|-----------|----------|
| U-A11Y01 | Score has `aria-live` | Screen readers announce score changes during gameplay |
| U-A11Y02 | Buttons have accessible labels | All `<button>` elements have meaningful text or `aria-label` attributes |
| U-A11Y03 | Keyboard-only gameplay | A user can navigate menus and activate powerups (keys 1–3) without a mouse |
| U-A11Y04 | Color is not the only indicator | Timer warning, streak state, and powerup readiness are distinguishable beyond color alone |
| U-A11Y05 | Sufficient contrast | Text elements meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) against their backgrounds |

---

## 3. Non-Functional Tests

### 3.1 Security

> These are the highest-priority tests for the backend API.

#### JWT & Authentication

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| S-JWT01 | Missing token rejected | Call any protected endpoint without `Authorization` header | `401` — `"Missing authentication token."` |
| S-JWT02 | Expired token rejected | Use a JWT signed with `exp` in the past | `401` — `"Invalid or expired authentication token."` |
| S-JWT03 | Tampered token rejected | Modify the payload of a valid JWT (e.g. change `sub`) and send it | `401` — signature mismatch detected by `jsonwebtoken` |
| S-JWT04 | Weak/missing `JWT_SECRET` blocks startup | Start the server with `JWT_SECRET=""` | Server throws and exits — does not start insecurely |
| S-JWT05 | Token not accepted by wrong secret | Sign a token with a different secret and send it | `401` — rejected |
| S-JWT06 | Role field is not user-controlled | Create a normal account; send a JWT with `role: "admin"` crafted client-side | Server re-derives role from the database, not the token payload |

#### Input Validation & Injection

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| S-INJ01 | SQL injection in username field | POST `/api/auth/signup` with `username: "' OR 1=1 --"` | Parameterized queries prevent injection; returns 400 (username rules) or 409 |
| S-INJ02 | Oversized username truncated/rejected | Submit a username of 500 characters | Returns `400` — `"Username must be 32 characters or less."` |
| S-INJ03 | Null/missing body fields handled | POST `/api/auth/login` with `{}` or `null` body | Returns `400`; server does not throw |
| S-INJ04 | `itemId` of unknown shop item rejected | POST `/api/shop/purchase` with a fabricated `itemId` | Returns an error — item not found in catalog |
| S-INJ05 | Progress fields with wrong types | PUT `/api/progress` with `coins: "drop table users"` | Field is ignored or cast safely; no server error |

#### Access Control

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| S-AC01 | Player cannot read another player's state | GET `/api/player/state` with a valid token belonging to user A | Returns only user A's data — no cross-user leakage |
| S-AC02 | Player cannot write another player's progress | PUT `/api/progress` using user A's token | Only user A's row is updated; user B's data is untouched |
| S-AC03 | CORS blocks unexpected origins | Send a request from an origin not listed in `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | Browser CORS policy blocks the response |

#### Password & Credential Security

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| S-PW01 | Passwords are hashed in the database | Inspect the `users` table after signup | `passwordHash` is a bcrypt hash (starts with `$2b$`), never plaintext |
| S-PW02 | Wrong password cannot be derived | Attempt login with every common password against a test account | bcrypt work factor (12) makes brute force computationally infeasible |
| S-PW03 | Error message is generic for login failures | Attempt login with a valid username and wrong password | Error says `"Invalid username or password."` — does not reveal whether username exists |

#### Frontend / Client-Side

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| S-FE01 | No secrets stored in `localStorage` | Inspect `localStorage` in DevTools after login | Only the JWT token and game progress are stored; no raw passwords |
| S-FE02 | Token is cleared on logout | Log out | `localStorage` entry for the token is removed; subsequent API calls fail with `401` |
| S-FE03 | No sensitive data in page source | View page source of a rendered page | No user credentials, secrets, or internal API keys visible |

---

### 3.2 Performance

| ID | Test Case | Criteria |
|----|-----------|----------|
| P-01 | Game loop runs smoothly | During a round, button movement and click feedback should run at 60 fps with no visible jank on a mid-range device |
| P-02 | Round end does not lag | Completing a round (progress sync + overlay render) should feel instant — target < 500 ms for the API round-trip |
| P-03 | Leaderboard loads quickly | `GET /api/leaderboard` (25 rows) should respond within 200 ms on a local network |
| P-04 | Large round history renders without freezing | A `roundHistory` with 200+ entries should not block the main thread when opening the History page |
| P-05 | Signup/login API response time | Auth endpoints should respond within 1 second (bcrypt `cost=12` is intentionally slow — this is expected and acceptable) |

---

### 3.3 Compatibility

| ID | Test Case | Criteria |
|----|-----------|----------|
| C-01 | Chrome (latest) | Full gameplay, auth, and shop work correctly |
| C-02 | Firefox (latest) | Full gameplay, auth, and shop work correctly |
| C-03 | Safari / WebKit | CSS animations and click events behave identically to Chrome |
| C-04 | Mobile browser (iOS Safari / Android Chrome) | Game is playable by tapping; layout stacks correctly; no horizontal scroll |
| C-05 | `localStorage` unavailable (private mode) | App shows a graceful error or fallback rather than crashing silently |
